# Graph Algorithms #

The most common way to store graphs are edge_list, adjacency_matrix, adjacency_list, and node_classes.

**Dfs**
- We need a stack or use recursion to travel, similar to tree dfs.
- We also need a hashmap to keep on track of traversed nodes and a graph can have cycles which a tree doesn't.

**Bfs**
- Similar to tree bfs.
- Like dfs we need to have hashmap to keep track of visited nodes.
